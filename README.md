=====

CODE, a Collaborative Document Editor which will be developed as a project for CSE223B - Distributed Computing and Systems course. We will utilise Googleâ€™s Operational Transformation to ensure consistency across multiple CODE client UIs. Furthermore, the fault-tolerance and resilience of the back-end will be based partly on the design of the Tribbler back-end, a system developed in the Labs for the same course.
